### Types of Input
#### Fast Text Input

##### Steno
Stenograph machines have 22 buttons and somewhere between 19 and 22 bits of input.

Most buttons are in pairs : and so the user can input two bits per finger, with only a very small movements required.
/Buttons arranged in a triangle ∴ can do three bits per finger, but more buttons than that drops the buttons to bits ratio (4 bits needs 5 buttons)./

There are various steno rough mappings, theories, from english phonetics to stenograph key chords to english graphemes - the primary design goal is transcription rather than text entry.
At a high level, the left fingers handle onsets, the thumbs handle the nuculus, and the right fingers do the coda.
/Directly mapping combinations to initial, medial, and final text snippets may be sufficently easier to learn to outweigh any disadvantage in encoding density of english words./

#### Relative XY or XYZ Input
##### Accelerometer?
* maybe also joystick-like features

### Interfaces
#### USB - kbd/mouse emulation
* this should also be the charging interface

#### Bluetooth - kbd/mouse emulation

#### PS/2
would be more amusing that actually useful.

### Physical Charactaristics
#### Small
* should be as easy to carry around and pick up as a phone

### Open Questions

#### ∴ buttons

Can we actually get three bits per finger with a triangle of (hexagonal?) buttons?

Initial experimentation on convenient (but sadly not NKRO) laptop keyboard suggests yes.
It was only very slightly harder to go between combinatinos of three keys than combinations of two keys.
Practice (and closer keys) would help both efforts.

#### hands

Is 15 bits (one hand, three bits per finger) enough, or do we need to use both hands?

#### mapping

Should the mapping be more orthagonal and systematic or fit better to the data?

#### mousing

What sort of mousing input?
